# ENGG-192
# Study Description
# A non-profit environmental foundation asks you to help them decide on whether they
# should develop a program to subsidize households in VT to switch from wood burning stoves to
# heat pumps with 800$ per case regardless of the house size. The argument some in the
# foundation make is that this change would reduce indoor and outdoor air pollution, the
# associated mortality, as well as the inequity of this mortality. (This is as precise a problem
# formulation as they provided.) This foundation has several environmental economists on the
# board. The economists question whether this investment could pass an expected value cost-
# benefit test (the “question”).
# Project tasks
# 1. Frame the analysis to respond to the question (and discuss alternative framings).
# 2. Review the literature on inputs and models you need to perform the analysis.
# 3. Prepare a report outlining a preliminary “desk-study” using inputs from the peer-
# reviewed and gray literature as well as your own documented assumptions.
# 4. Document your sources and the assumptions.
# 5. Document your calculations using open-source software and a GitHub repository.
# 6. Discuss. and possible quantify the (in your assessment) key uncertainties that drive the
# answers to the questions.
